    "\n",
    "Many matrices in applications, particularly the study of physical systems and graphs/networks, have entries that are mostly equal to zero.  We can more efficiently store such systems by storing only the nonzero elements.  We will discuss storage and optimized implementations later.  Many of the methods for sparse systems apply to solving systems with matrices $A$ that can be applied to a vector ($y \\gets A x$) in significantly less than $O(n^2)$ complexity, or that are \"well-conditioned\" such that an iterative method converges in significantly less than $n$ iterations.\n",

    "[PETSc](https://mcs.anl.gov/petsc), the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computing, is an open source software package for the parallel solution of algebraic and differential-algebraic equations.  This includes linear algebra, for which PETSc offers a broad variety of implementations.  For general information about PETSc, I refer to [this primer](https://jedbrown.org/files/20150924-PETScPrimer.pdf).\n",

    "### Richardson iteration\n",
    "The simplest iterative method is [Richardson's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Richardson_iteration), which solves $A x = b$ by the iteration\n",
    "$$ x_{k+1} = x_k + \\omega (b - A x_k) $$\n",

    "$$ x_{k+1} - x_* = (x_k - x_*) - \\omega A (x_k - x_*) = (I - \\omega A) (x_k - x_*) .$$\n",

    "in terms of the initial error.  Evidently powers of the *iteration matrix* $I - \\omega A$ tell the whole story.\n",
    "Suppose that the eigendecomposition\n",
    "$$ X \\Lambda X^{-1} = I - \\omega A $$\n",
    "exists.  Then\n",
    "$$ (I - \\omega A)^k = (X \\Lambda X^{-1})^k = X \\Lambda^k X^{-1} $$\n",
    "and the convergence (or divergence) rate depends only on the largest magnitude eigenvalue.\n",
    "This analysis isn't great for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Not all matrices are diagonalizable.\n",
    "2. The matrix $X$ may be very ill-conditioned.\n",

    "We can repair these weaknesses by using the [Schur decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_decomposition)\n",

    "where $R$ is right-triangular and $Q$ is unitary (i.e., orthogonal if real-valued; $Q^h$ is the Hermitian conjugate of $Q$).\n",
    "The Schur decomposition always exists and $Q$ has a condition number of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where are the eigenvalues in $R$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently we must find $\\omega$ to minimize the maximum eigenvalue of $I - \\omega A$.  We can do this if $A$ is well conditioned, but not in general.\n",

    "### Preconditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Preconditioning is the act of creating an \"affordable\" operation \"$P^{-1}$\" such that $P^{-1} A$ (or $A P^{-1}$) is is well-conditoned or otherwise has a \"nice\" spectrum.  We then solve the system\n",

    "\n",
    "* The preconditioner must be applied on each iteration.\n",
    "* It is *not* merely about finding a good initial guess.\n",

    "There are two complementary techniques necessary for efficient iterative methods:\n",

    "* \"accelerators\" or Krylov methods, which use orthogonality to adaptively converge faster than Richardson\n",
    "* preconditioners that improve the spectrum of the preconditioned operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is ongoing research in Krylov methods and they are immensely useful, I would say preconditioning is 90% of the game for practical applications, particularly as a research area."

The leading cost is $2mn$ where $m \\gg n$.\n",
    "* The residual vector $r_n = A x_n - b$ is not explicitly available in GMRES.  To compute it, first build the solution $x_n$ as above.\n",
    "* GMRES needs to store the full $Q_n$, which is unaffordable for large $n$ (many iterations).  The standard solution is to choose a \"restart\" $k$ and to discard $Q_n$ and start over with an initial guess $x_k$ after each $k$ iterations.  This algorithm is called GMRES(k).  PETSc's default solver is GMRES(30) and the restart can be controlled using the run-time option `-ksp_gmres_restart`.\n",
    "* Most implementations of GMRES use classical Gram-Schmidt because it is much faster in parallel (one reduction per iteration instead of $n$ reductions per iteration).  The PETSc option `-ksp_gmres_modifiedgramschmidt` can be used when you suspect that classical Gram-Schmidt may be causing instability.\n",
    "* There is a very similar (and older) algorithm called GCR that maintains $x_n$ and $r_n$.  This is useful, for example, if a convergence tolerance needs to inspect individual entries.  GCR requires $2n$ vectors instead of $n$ vectors, and can tolerate a nonlinear preconditioner.  FGMRES is a newer algorithm with similar properties to GCR.\n",

    "### Lanczos iteration: the symmetric case\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A$ is symmetric, then $H = Q^T A Q$ is also symmetric.  Since $H$ is Hessenberg, this means $H$ is tridiagonal.  Instead of storing $Q_n$, it is sufficient to store only the last two columns since the iteration satisfies a 3-term recurrence.  The analog of GMRES for the symmetric case is called MINRES and is also useful for solving symmetric indefinite problems.\n",

    "#### Conjugate Gradients\n",

    "Instead of minimizing the $A^T A$ norm of the error, the Conjugate Gradient method minimizes the $A$ norm of the error.  For $A$ to induce a norm, it must be symmetric positive definite.  [Jeremy Shewchuck's guide to CG](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Equake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf) is an excellent resource."
